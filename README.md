# AI Interview Coach

## Project Overview

Many students and fresh graduates have strong technical knowledge but struggle to perform effectively in interviews due to poor communication, weak eye contact, nervous body language, and lack of interview practice. As a result, they often face rejection despite having the required skills.

AI Interview Coach is an intelligent interview preparation system that helps candidates assess and improve their interview performance. Using Computer Vision and Speech Analysis, it evaluates eye contact, head movements, posture, speaking pace, and filler word usage while answering interview questions.

The system generates a performance report with actionable feedback, helping candidates identify weaknesses, track improvement, and build confidence before real interviews.
